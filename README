DEPENDENCIES

ParleVision depends on:
* Qt      >= 4.6    # parlevision-core depends on Qt-core for signals&slots, 
                    # parlevision-gui depends on the Qt-GUI bindings as well
* OpenCV  >= 2.0

INSTALLING DEPENDENCIES
1. Download and install Qt from http://qt.nokia.com/downloads
2. Install OpenCV. This depends on your OS:
    * Mac OS X - the easiest way is to install through MacPorts
    * Windows - You can get GCC or Visual Studio binaries from http://opencv.willowgarage.com/
                If you want to build using Qt Creator, use the GCC ones.

FIXING BUILD ENVIRONMENT
If your libraries are in different locations, you might have to tell the build system where to find them. You can make a personal ParleVision.pro.local (see ParleVision.local.example).
                
BUILDING PARLEVISION
To build ParleVision from source, you need the Qt SDK, which can be obtained from http://qt.nokia.com/. Depending on your platform, there are different options for building:

A. Using Qt Creator (all platforms)
Open ParleVision.pro in the Qt Creator IDE. Choose whether you want to build in Debug or Release mode using the "Build/Run Target Selector" and then select "Build Project 'ParleVision'".

B. Using Make (unix)
...

C. Using XCode
